This script is a modification of the script posted here:
http://tekrat.com/2008/02/21/vim-diff/

It allows you to quickly toggle (through a keybinding, Ctrl-D by default) the highlighting of changed lines in a file through an SCM's diff command.

It also binds Ctrl-G to :set nodiff to quickly turn off the highlighting.

The original script was written for git, but this version works for (at least) Mercurial and Subversion as well.  CVS and Perforce likely work but have not been tested.

It likely only works on Unix systems, or at least systems with 'cat' and 'patch', in addition to the SCM's command.

Configuration consists of the variable g:SCMDiffCommand, which if not set will be set to 'svn', assuming Subversion.  If g:SCMDiffCommand is set to 'hg', it works for Mercurial, and likewise 'git' for git.
